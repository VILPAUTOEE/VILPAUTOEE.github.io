The Japanese pop rock band reGretGirl's song "whiteout" delves into the heartache and pain of a love that has come to an end. The lyrics, written in Japanese, follow a phone conversation between two people, with one person telling the other that they have fallen in love with someone else. As the listener hears their loved one's voice tremble with the news, they are overwhelmed with emotions and unable to speak.

The lyrics describe the scene as the listener's mind goes white with grief and the windshield becomes blurry. The listener regrets not being able to express their true feelings and wishes they had spoken more of their thoughts. As they watch their loved one's heart pull away from them, they know they cannot say, "I want to see you."

Despite the pain and desperation, the listener feels that there must be a way to fix things, but it is already too late. The memories of their past, the kisses and love shared, and the person themselves are all fading away as the time they spent together becomes a memory leading up to the loved one's new beginning with someone else.

In Japanese, the lyrics of "whiteout" touch on the theme of lost love and the feeling of hopelessness that comes with it. As the listener's surroundings become white, symbolizing the end of the relationship, they reflect on the mundane days spent together, fighting and holding each other close. The phrase "the person I love" (好きな人, suki na hito) is repeated, emphasizing the deep pain of the loss. The listener wishes they could go back to the past and spend more time together, but it is too late and they are left with the realization that the memories, smiles, and even themselves are disappearing along with the love and kisses shared (キスも、愛も、君も, kisu mo, ai mo, kimi mo).

As with Saucy Dog's song "itsuka," "whiteout" serves as a poignant reflection on love and the passage of time. Both songs explore the bittersweet memories of past relationships and the emotions that come with moving on. While "itsuka" looks back on the joy and love shared in the past, "whiteout" delves into the heartache of a love that ended
