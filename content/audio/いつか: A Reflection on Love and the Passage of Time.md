The Japanese song "Itsuka" tells the story of two people's relationship and the memories they have together. The lyrics describe the different moments and activities they shared, such as climbing a hill and seeing the stars ("Someday, at the top of the hill in the darkness, the stars looked beautiful" - いつか 坂道を登った先の暗がり　星が綺麗に見えるってさ), holding hands for the first time in the cold season ("In the place where we fell to the ground on the ground, I thought *'Ah, that's like you'* " - 地べたに寝転んじゃう辺り　あぁ君らしいなって思ったり), and sharing an umbrella while swinging on a playground ("Holding one umbrella between the two of us, looking at the stars while riding on a swing" - ふたりでひとつの傘をさしたり　ブランコに乗り星を眺めたり).

The narrator reflects on their time together and expresses a desire to share their experiences and memories with the other person ("I wanted to make all the scenery I saw mine" - 僕の見た景色を全部　君のものにしてみたかったんだ). They also describe feeling a sense of weightlessness and dreaminess while being with the other person ("Floating and dreamy by your side" - ふわふわと夢心地　君の隣).

The lyrics also touch on the theme of change and the passage of time. The narrator mentions that the signal lights that they used to see on their usual road have disappeared ("It seems that the signal lights on the road we used to pass through have disappeared" - 当たり前に通ってたあの道　信号機は無くなるみたいです), and that their feelings of nostalgia will eventually fade away ("It seems that the feelings of remembering and becoming sad will disappear someday" - 思い出して切なくなる気持ちも　いつかは無くなるみたいです).

The song ends with the narrator hoping to see the other person again in the future, with a smile on their face that does not hide any lies ("See you, see you, somewhere far away someday" - じゃあね　じゃあね　またどっか遠くで　いつか). Overall, "Itsuka" is a bittersweet reflection on a past relationship and the memories shared between the two people. It touches on themes of change, the passage of time, and the desire to hold on to the special moments shared with someone else.
