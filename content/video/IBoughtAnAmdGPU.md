The recent video by Mental Outlaw, "I Bought an AMD GPU for More Freedom," highlights the benefits of using an AMD graphics card on a Linux system. While Nvidia graphics cards are popular and widely used, they often require proprietary drivers to work properly on a Linux system. This can lead to problems such as black screens after the grub menu, or certain distros and configurations not working at all with Nvidia cards.

In contrast, AMD graphics cards come with proper open source drivers that are included in the upstream Linux kernel, making them more compatible with a wider range of distros and configurations. This means that users can enjoy a better "just works" experience with AMD graphics cards, as they tend to work out of the box on new distros without requiring any additional driver installation or modification.

In addition, Mental Outlaw points out that AMD graphics cards have a lower power draw and often come with thicker heatsinks, making them a good choice for those who are looking to build a Linux system with a focus on energy efficiency and temperature control.

Overall, the decision to switch to an AMD graphics card on a Linux system comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of the user. However, it is clear that AMD graphics cards offer some significant benefits for those who are looking to enjoy a more seamless and hassle-free experience on their Linux system.
