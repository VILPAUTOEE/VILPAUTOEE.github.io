Recently, there has been growing concern over a new policy proposed by the European Union (EU) called "check control." This policy is intended to protect children online by requiring client-side scanning of all online communications for child sexual abuse material (CSAM). However, many are worried that this policy poses a serious threat to online privacy and software freedom.

The proposed law is similar in nature to the features that Apple implemented, where they scan iCloud accounts for CSAM to protect children. However, the EU policy is a million times worse because it's a regulation being proposed by the government. This means that every manufacturer that wants to sell in the EU will have to comply with this regulation. While companies like Apple may comply with the regulation to continue selling their products in the EU market, complying with the regulation will be more challenging for software developers and companies that run online services.

The proposal requires client-side scanning of all communications, which means that every company that runs any app or email service that allows online communication will have to actively scan people's messages for CSAM. This includes companies that are not explicitly marketed towards children, but that children may use to communicate. This would mean that any online service that a child might use, whether it's an email service or a messaging app, will have to be scanned.

This proposal poses a real threat to software freedom because it would require every company to scan all messages for CSAM. This means that even open-source apps like Signal, Molly, Yami, Session, Simple X Chat, and Matrix will have to comply with the regulation, which seems unlikely. If they don't comply, they will not be able to sell their products in the EU market.

Furthermore, if the proposals are taken to their logical end, then the end result would be a ban on open-source operating systems. The only way to effectively implement chat control would be to require everyone to use an operating system that can scan all messages sent through any app, email, text message, or voice message. This would be a massive threat to online privacy and software freedom, as it would require every communication to be scanned and monitored.

The proposal may have good intentions, but the potential consequences for online privacy and software freedom are significant. Many people are worried about the implications of this proposal, and some are even calling for it to be scrapped altogether. While protecting children is undoubtedly important, it is crucial to balance that with the need for online privacy and software freedom.

In conclusion, the EU's proposed chat control law is a significant threat to online privacy and software freedom. While protecting children online is important, it should not come at the expense of online privacy and freedom. It is essential to find a balance that protects both children and online privacy, and that does not stifle innovation and software freedom.
