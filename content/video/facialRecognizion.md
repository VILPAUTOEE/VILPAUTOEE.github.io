Facial recognition technology has been a controversial topic for years, with concerns ranging from privacy violations to potential biases in the algorithms. Madison Square Garden Entertainment has recently come under fire for using facial recognition technology in a way that goes beyond what most would consider reasonable.

According to a recent video by Mental Outlaw, Madison Square Garden entertainment used their security cameras, equipped with facial recognition technology, to identify and then have security kick out patrons who were even slightly associated with a law firm that was involved in a lawsuit against the company. Kelly Colon, who was escorted out of the venue, had never practiced law in New York or ever been involved in any lawsuits against MSG entertainment. However, she was an associate for Davis Saperstein and Solomon, a law firm that was involved in a lawsuit against a restaurant that was later purchased by MSG entertainment.

This incident raises serious questions about the limitations that should be applied to companies that want to deploy facial recognition technology on their own property. While businesses do have the right to refuse service to people under certain circumstances, it seems unfair for people who have purchased tickets to be denied access to a venue by an automated system. In this case, it appears that the amount of money that the arenas are going to be losing in lawsuits from denied patrons may not be worth the money saved by using facial recognition to deny certain people access.

Furthermore, this incident highlights the potential for facial recognition technology to be used in petty and malicious ways. It's one thing to use the technology to identify criminals or individuals who have previously been trespassed from the premises, but it's quite another to use it to target those who are only tangentially related to a lawsuit against the company.

Overall, this case serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of facial recognition technology. While it may be useful in some circumstances, it's important for companies and individuals to consider the ethical implications of using this technology and to ensure that it is not being used to violate the privacy or rights of others.
