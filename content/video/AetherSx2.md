It's always disheartening to see a beloved open source project come to an end, but it's even more distressing when the reason behind the project's demise is due to a toxic community. This is exactly what happened with Aether sx2, a popular open source multi-platform Playstation 2 emulator that allowed users to play PS2 games on their Android devices or PCs.

According to the developer, the main reason behind the cessation of development was due to "NeverEnding impersonating complaints, demands, and now death threats." In a message posted on the Aether sx2 website, the developer stated that the project was always meant to be a hobby and was never intended to be profit-driven. However, the constant negativity and hostility from certain members of the community had made it no longer enjoyable for the developer to continue working on the project.

It's unclear exactly what led to the toxic atmosphere within the Aether sx2 community, but it's likely that some members were unhappy with the direction the project was taking or with certain decisions made by the developer. It's also possible that there were individuals who were attempting to scam or impersonate the developer, which likely added to the stress and frustration of maintaining the project.

Unfortunately, it seems that the toxic behavior within the Aether sx2 community was the final straw for the developer, leading to the decision to halt development and shut down the project's social media pages and Discord channel. It's a sad end to what was once a beloved open source project, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of fostering a positive and supportive community within any project or organization.
