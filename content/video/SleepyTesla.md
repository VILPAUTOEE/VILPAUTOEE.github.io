As technology advances and self-driving vehicles become more prevalent on our roads, incidents of drivers falling asleep behind the wheel of their Tesla have been on the rise. In a recent case in Germany, a man was caught driving at 110 kilometers per hour on the Autobahn with his eyes closed and hands off the steering wheel. When pulled over by police, the man appeared to be under the influence of drugs and had his license suspended until a court can decide on potential criminal charges.

But this isn't the first time such an incident has occurred. In 2018, a video of a Tesla driver asleep at the wheel while on the highway went viral, with the car traveling for miles before being pulled over by police. In this case, the driver claimed to have simply been "tired," but was issued a citation for "inattentive driving."

These incidents highlight the dangers of relying too heavily on self-driving technology and the importance of staying vigilant while behind the wheel, even if your car is capable of driving itself. While Tesla's Autopilot feature is designed to assist drivers and not replace them, it is not foolproof and requires the driver to remain alert and ready to take control at any moment.

It's also worth noting that these incidents may have legal implications for both the driver and the company. If a driver is found to be at fault for an accident while using Autopilot, they may face criminal charges. Similarly, if it is found that Tesla's technology was not functioning properly or was being used improperly, the company could also be held liable.

In the end, the responsibility for safely operating a vehicle lies with the driver. While self-driving technology has the potential to greatly improve safety on our roads, it's important to remember that it is not a replacement for human attention and caution. Drivers must remain alert and ready to take control at all times to ensure the safety of themselves and those around them.
