The video "The LastPass Hack Was Worse Than We Thought" by Mental Outlaw discusses the recent data breach suffered by the popular password manager service, LastPass. In August of 2022, the company initially disclosed that a hacker had breached one of their developer accounts and stolen portions of their source code and some proprietary technical information. However, it has now been revealed that user information and some password vault data has also been compromised in the hack.

The hackers used keys that they had stolen from a LastPass employee to decrypt storage volumes stored within the company's cloud-based storage services. This data included metadata about LastPass customers, such as company names, billing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and IP addresses. While this information is not considered critical by LastPass, it can be valuable to hackers as they can use it to gather information about specific companies and improve their plan of attack.

In addition, it has been discovered that the hackers were able to access the hashed master passwords of some LastPass users. These master passwords are used to access the password vaults of individual users, so if the hackers are able to successfully crack the hashes, they would be able to access the password vaults of those users. However, LastPass has stated that they believe the risk of this occurring is low, as the hashed passwords were salted and hashed with a strong algorithm.

Overall, it is important for LastPass users to be aware of the severity of this data breach and take necessary precautions to protect their accounts. This includes using unique, strong passwords for their LastPass account and enabling two-factor authentication. It is also recommended to regularly review and update the passwords stored in their password vault to ensure the continued security of their personal information.
